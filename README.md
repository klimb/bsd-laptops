## FreeBSD and OpenBSD on laptops!!!


Purpose: 
* to get all hardware working perfect on specific laptops
* this is like /usr/ports .. but for laptops, and so you know what to buy :)
* What is the best laptop for FreeBSD or OpenBSD? (we'll answer this question with automation)

Friends, would you please share your system configs and dmesg (by making some commits here) so we can get all hardware working perfect on specific laptop models? Suspend/resume, webcam, audio, headphones, built-in & external mic, fingerprint reader, WIFI cards, etc. I'll make you admin/collaborator if you'd like to help out. Or just share it by email (dvk@klimb.com).

Thank you!!!

We're going to automate getting hardware to work 100% perfect, but for now .. collecting system configs.
