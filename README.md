FreeBSD and OpenBSD system configs to get all hardware working perfect

Hello friends, would you please share your system configs and dmesg so we can get all hardware working perfect on specific laptop models?
Suspend/resume, webcam, sound, etc

Thank you!!!

(we're going to automate getting hardware to work 100% perfect, for now collecting configs)
